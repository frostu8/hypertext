      <p>
        ACCORDING TO <span class="orange">ACCEPTED DEFINITIONS,</span>
        A CITY IS SIMPLY A LARGE TOWN, BUT WHEN THE WORD "CITY"
        IS USED TO <span class="orange">DESCRIBE</span> AN AREA
        WHERE HUMANS LIVE CERTAIN IMPLICATIONS ARISE.
      </p>
      <p>
        CITIES INCREASE THE COMFORTABLE POPULATION PER SQUARE METER
        IN A CERTAIN AREA OF LAND, ALLOWING MORE HUMANS TO EXIST IN
        THE SAME COLUMN OF AREA. HIGHRISES, SKYSCRAPERS AND
        APARMENTS INCREASE THE POPULATION PER SQUARE METER. IF THE
        WORLD EVENTUALLY HAD TO EXIST IN AN AREA AS SMALL AS SOUTH
        KOREA, LIKE THE KOWLOON WALLED CITY, WOULD IT BE A COMFORTABLE
        PLACE TO LIVE?
      </p>
      <p>
        A LIFE IN A CITY SUCH AS THIS WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE
        LAWS IN. FINDING A PLACE TO CALL HOME CALMLY WOULD BE DIFFICULT.
        BUT IN THIS CITY, DREAMS AND ASPIRATIONS WOULD PERSIST, AND
        SELF-DETERMINATION WOULD REIGN SUPREME.

        THE <a href="innernet.html">INTERNET</a> IS OFTEN COMPARED TO
        A GLOBAL CITY OR VILLAGE.
