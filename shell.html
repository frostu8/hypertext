      A WORLD WHERE ANDROIDS AND HUMANS COEXIST WITH ONE ANOTHER. IS
      HUMANITY SOMETHING SUCH WORTH PROTECTING THAT THE ONLY LIFE
      IMAGINABLE FOR THE VALIANT DON IS ONE BORN OF FLESH? IS THE
      CONCEPT OF THE GHOST BORNE FROM A TRUE DISTINCTION OR JUST THE
      SATISFACTORY CONCLUSION THAT HUMANITY IS SPECIAL?

    <p>
      AND OF COURSE, IF WE OBTAINED THE TECHNOLOGY TO CREATE A BEING
      ORIGINALLY BORN OF FLESH AND COPIED TO A COMPUTER, WOULD THAT
      NEW BEING NO LONGER HAVE A GHOST WITHIN THE SHELL?
